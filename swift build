This will download the necessary dependencies (like SwiftOSC) and compile the application. The first build might take a minute. The final executable will be placed in the `.build/debug/` directory.

### 3. Configure Your Tangent Controller

You need to configure your Tangent controller to send OSC messages to your computer's IP address.

1.  **Find your Mac's IP Address**: Go to `System Settings` > `Wi-Fi` (or `Ethernet`), click on the `Details...` button for your active network connection, and find your IP Address under the `TCP/IP` tab. It will look something like `192.168.1.100`.
2.  **Configure Tangent Mapper**:
    - Open the Tangent Mapper application.
    - Go to the "Configuration" tab.
    - Set the protocol to **OSC**.
    - Set the **Host** to your Mac's IP address.
    - Set the **Port** to `9000` (or whatever you configure in `main.swift`).
    - Make sure the controller is active and sending data.

### 4. Run the Bridge Application

In the same Terminal window (still in the project's root folder), you can run the application using the Swift command:
